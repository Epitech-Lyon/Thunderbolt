# Thunderbolt

Thunderbolt is a set of functions used for a basic Cloud control.

For now and being limited by my knowledge only AWS functions are provided.

All the functions can be deployed using the relevant provided service on cloud.

This is not a real project but some tools shared, usable, deployable.
